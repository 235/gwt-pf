Install GWT-PF

To use GWT-PF in your GWT existing project do following 
(instructions are for an Eclipse project, but should work for 
any IDE with reasonable adjustments):

1. Unpack files, and put them in an any folder of your GWT project. 
Good place would be "lib" folder.

2. Setup GWT for your project.
In Eclipse go to "Project->Properties", "Java Build Path" menu item
and "Libraries" tab, push "Add JARs..." button - find and select
gwt-pf-core.jar, press OK. This would add the source code of the
distribution to your project. Now you should be able to use the
libraries in your code. Repeat same that for gwt-pf-ui.jar.

3. In Eclipse in the "Package Explorer", select file
"projectName.gwt.xml (should be in package "com.companyName"). Under
the line "<inherits name='com.google.gwt.user.User'/>"  add
"<inherits name='net.pleso.framework.plesoframework'/>"

4. In root folder of your project find and edit "projectName-compile.cmd" 
and "projectName-shell.cmd" files. On the first
line you will see a command similar to:

"@java -cp "%~dp0\src;--PATH--;--PATH--;"

Those --PATH-- are "gwt-user.jar" and "gwt-dev-windows.jar". Add a new path to 
"gwt-pf-core.jar" and "gwt-pf-ui.jar" in both files. 
After this, you'll be able to run project both in hosted mode and web mode.
